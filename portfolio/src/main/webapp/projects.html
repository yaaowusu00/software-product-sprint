        <h2>WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Web App</h2>
        <p> In summer 2019, I created a web application for the WHO Mental Health Gap project using JavaScript, Node.js and Vue basics under the direction of Dr. Benedict Brown.
          At the end of the summer, we began the process of converting the web app in to a native Android application.

        <p> The purpose of the app is to assist primary healthcare workers in rural areas in diagnosing mental health conditions. 
            The video above demonstrates the protocol for diagnosing psychosis, but working off of a previous hard-coded version, I coded the app in such a way  
            that I used a JSON with a specific structure to encode the diagnosis flow chart, so that the web app could be generalized
             to the diagnosis of any other conditions encoded in a JSON with the same structure.

        <h2>Atari Breakout</h2>
        <p> For a final project in my Intro to Programming Class,
           I worked with a partner to replicate the popular Atari Breakout Game, using Object-Oriented Programming and linked lists. </p>
